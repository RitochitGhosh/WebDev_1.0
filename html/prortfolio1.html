                    <p>
                        I am Ritochit Ghosh, currently in the first year
                        of my four-year BTech course in Computer Science
                        and Engineering at Maulana Abul Kalam University of Technology,West Bengal. My academic journey took an unexpected turn. Initially, I was a NEET aspirant with little prior
                        knowledge about computer science. Despite dedicating two
                        years to NEET preparation and performing well in mock tests,
                        the actual NEET paper proved to be a significant challenge.
                        I found myself under immense pressure and nervousness,
                        resulting in a rank of something around 108,000 with a
                        score of 500 out of 720. Interestingly, I had not planned
                        on taking JEE Mains or any other engineering entrance exams.
                        However, my father, perhaps foreseeing an opportunity,
                        filled out the WBJEE examination form for me. At that time,
                        I had no familiarity with engineering entrance exams or their
                        structure. I remember solving a few Physics and Chemistry PYQs
                        for the JEE main paper. My exposure to mathematics was limited
                        to the higher secondary examination, where I secured 92% from
                        the WBCHSE board. I approached the WBJEE examination on July 1
                        with a positive mindset, treating it as a mock test before the
                        NEET. The physics and chemistry sections were manageable,
                        as they were based on concepts that were already clear to me.
                        However, in the mathematics section, I faced challenges, having
                        solved only a few questions due to a lack of practice since my
                        higher secondary examination. Until the release of the results,
                        engineering had not crossed my mind as a career option. I was
                        prepared to reattempt the NEET paper, feeling demotivated and
                        disheartened after what I considered the worst exam of my life.
                        However, when I realized my performance in WBJEE would assure me
                        a place in a government engineering college, I participated in the
                        counseling process. Though I was initially against it, after
                        several discussions with my relatives and friends, I considered
                        shifting my focus from medical, as that would be a too-long path
                        for establishing a career.
                        Thus, this is how I got into my present college...
                        But honestly now I am enjoying this tech journey a lot.
